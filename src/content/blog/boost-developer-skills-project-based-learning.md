## How Project-Based Learning Can Help Developers Improve Their Logical Thinking and Finish Projects

As developers, we often find ourselves stuck in the rut of learning theory without actually applying it. This can lead to a lack of confidence and a pile of unfinished projects. But what if there was a way to boost your logical thinking and develop the habit of seeing things through to completion? Enter project-based learning (PBL).

Project-based learning is a powerful approach that focuses on hands-on projects to help you understand and apply concepts in real-world scenarios. For me, this method has been a game-changer, turning abstract knowledge into tangible skills. In this post, I'll share how PBL can help you as a developer, improve your logical thinking, and, most importantly, get you to finish what you start.

### What is Project-Based Learning (PBL)?

Project-based learning is an educational approach where learning occurs through engaging with projects. Unlike traditional learning methods that often emphasize theory, PBL focuses on practical application. You learn by doing, solving real-world problems, and creating actual products.

In the context of software development, PBL can mean building a web app, developing a game, or, in my case, creating a Manga Tracker with a web scraper. The key elements that make PBL effective include:

- **Real-world relevance:** Projects are based on real-world challenges, making the learning process more engaging.
- **Active exploration:** You actively research, design, and develop solutions.
- **Collaboration:** Often, PBL involves working with others, which enhances learning through shared knowledge and experience.
- **Reflection:** Continuous reflection helps solidify what you’ve learned and how you can improve.

### Benefits of Project-Based Learning for Developers

#### Improves Logical Thinking

When you’re working on a project, you’re constantly solving problems. This continuous problem-solving process sharpens your logical thinking. For instance, in my Manga Tracker project, I had to figure out how to build a web scraper to download the most recent manga chapters directly to my Kindle. Each piece of the project presented its own challenges, from handling the web scraping process to transforming images into a PDF and sending it via email.

By building the Manga Tracker multiple times using different languages—first with JavaScript and Puppeteer, then Golang, and finally Rust—I used a familiar project to learn new programming languages. This approach forced me to think critically and make decisions at every step, significantly improving my logical thinking skills.

#### Promotes Practical Skills

PBL isn’t just about thinking; it’s about doing. You apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, which helps you understand concepts more deeply. By working on real projects, you get hands-on experience with the tools and technologies that are crucial in your field. For example, while working on the Manga Tracker, I gained practical experience in web scraping, data transformation, and email automation—skills that are directly applicable to many other areas in development.

#### Boosts Confidence and Motivation

There’s nothing quite like the sense of accomplishment that comes from finishing a project. It boosts your confidence and keeps you motivated. Having completed projects to show prospective employers or clients is a huge plus. For example, my Manga Tracker wasn’t what landed me a job, but a mobile app I developed to help remember medicines did. These projects showcased my skills and helped me gain trust even when I didn't have much professional experience.

### Developing a Habit of Finishing Projects

One of the biggest challenges developers face is finishing what they start. Here’s how PBL can help you develop this crucial habit:

#### Setting Realistic Goals and Deadlines

Breaking down your project into manageable chunks with clear, achievable goals and deadlines can make a big difference. It helps prevent overwhelm and keeps you focused on making steady progress.

#### Iterative Development and Feedback

Working iteratively—developing small parts of your project, seeking feedback, and refining your approach—keeps you on track. It also ensures you’re moving in the right direction and allows for adjustments along the way.

#### Overcoming Common Obstacles

Procrastination and perfectionism are common obstacles that can derail your projects. By setting clear priorities and focusing on iterative development, you can overcome these challenges and keep moving forward.

### Structuring a Simple Project: The Manga Tracker Example

One of the projects I often use to learn new things is my Manga Tracker. The main challenge wasn't keeping my reading list up to date but building a web scraper to download the most recent manga chapters directly to my Kindle. I’ll break down this project in another blog post, but for now, let's use it as an example of how to structure a simple project.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Project-Based Learning

1. **Choose a Project Based on Your Interests:**

   - **Example:** I love reading manga, so I came up with the idea of a Manga Tracker to keep track of my reads and quickly download all manga chapters directly to my Kindle.

2. **Write Down Ideas:**

   - **Example:** I brainstormed everything about the Manga Tracker, including tracking my reading list and the web scraper for downloading manga. I wrote down all ideas, no matter how difficult or trivial they seemed.

3. **Select Key Items:**

   - **Example:** From the list, I picked three core functionalities: the reading list tracker, the web scraper to gather manga images, and the PDF creator to send the manga to my Kindle. This helped me focus on essential features without getting overwhelmed.

4. **Plan Each Item:**

   - **Example:** For the web scraper, I detailed steps like identifying the manga on a scans site, downloading chapter images, converting them to PDF, and automating the email process to Kindle. This planning phase cleared my mind and created a roadmap.

5. **Start Small and Iterate:**

   - **Example:** I began by implementing the web scraper in JavaScript with Puppeteer, then iteratively improved it by adding features and seeking feedback. Later, I rebuilt it in Golang and Rust to learn new languages.

6. **Share Your Progress:**
   - **Example:** I shared updates on LinkedIn and other platforms, even when the project was incomplete. Sharing helped me stay motivated and get feedback. Most of my early projects are archived now, but I still build things for myself and share them, like my Pomodoro Timer for MacOS using Tauri and React.

By following these steps, you can turn vague ideas into concrete projects and develop a habit of finishing what you start.

### Sharing Your Projects

No matter where you are in your project, share something about it. Post an image, write a blog post, or share on social media. Let people know you’re building something, even if you think it looks ugly or incomplete. Sharing helps you stay motivated and provides valuable feedback. For example, my early projects helped me gain trust even when I didn't have much professional experience. Recently, I built a simple TUI app for managing tasks directly from my terminal and I'm planning on sharing it online.

### Conclusion

Project-based learning has been a key part of my growth as a developer. It’s helped me improve my logical thinking, develop practical skills, and finish what I start. I encourage you to find a project that excites you, break it down into manageable parts, and start building. Share
